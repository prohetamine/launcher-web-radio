# Launcher Web Radio

> launcher-web-radio - radio station for nodejs, this example is for the main radio-station library.

### Why ?
This example shows how you can start a broadcast using voice on the air to make everything work connect to the [radio-launcher](https://github.com/prohetamine/radio-launcher) and add tracks, and this is just an example, the official documentation can be found in [radio-station](https://github.com/prohetamine/radio-station), but if you prefer automation and endless online radio, just use the server version [node-web-radio](https://github.com/prohetamine/node-web-radio), it does not require the use of a launcher and can also be controlled using nodejs

### Get started

Clone the github repository and install nodejs.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/prohetamine/launcher-web-radio.git
$ cd launcher-web-radio
$ npm install
```

### Examples and description

Now just run and go to the default address http://localhost:8080 and control the broadcast using the [radio-launcher](https://github.com/prohetamine/radio-launcher). Attention: until you add any tracks, the broadcast will not start

```sh
$ npm run start
```
